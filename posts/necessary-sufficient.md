Every so often I need to refresh my memory about the intuitive meaning of the "necessary" and "sufficient" conditions in mathematics. Chances are, you do too. So I'm writing this post to have as clear exposition as possible.

## set view

## logic view

Define any two events: $P$ and $Q$.

"P is a necessary condition for Q" means: $P \Leftarrow Q$

"P is a sufficient condition for Q" means: $P \Rightarrow Q$
