Every so often I need to refresh my memory about the intuitive meaning of the "necessary" and "sufficient" conditions in mathematical logic. Chances are, you do too. So I'm writing this post to have as clear exposition as possible, since there is a tremendous volume of resources on the Internet that seem to do nothing but convolute these concepts. My goal for this post is to be the go-to reference on the web for this topic.

Let's start with the definitions and focus on implication. We first define any two events: $P$ and $Q$.

"P is a necessary condition for Q" means: $P \Leftarrow Q$

"P is a sufficient condition for Q" means: $P \Rightarrow Q$
